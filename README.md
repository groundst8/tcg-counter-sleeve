# TCG Counter Sleeve

## Possibilities

### Cardstock credit card sleeve

Various companies offer cardstock credit card sleeves. [Company Folders](https://www.companyfolders.com/) will do a die cut front face cutout for the display. 
A couple concerns with this approach are minimum quantity orders and bending of the sleeve faces that makes the display hard to see.

### Proxy card face in poly card sleeve

Another idea is to create a proxy card front face using one the many proxy services like [Printing Proxies](https://www.printingproxies.com) and then inserting 
the PCB and front face card into a standard poly card sleeve. Concerns with this approach is whether a cutout can be done by the proxy manufacturer and ESD discarge
concerns from the poly material. Some benefits are that it would be easy for people to make their own custom faces with no minimum order quantity assumming the same
policy as standard proxies would apply to having a cutout.
